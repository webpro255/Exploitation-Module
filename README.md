# Exploitation-Module: Automated Vulnerability Exploitation Tool

Welcome to **Exploitation-Module**, an easy-to-use terminal-based tool designed to help cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers automate the process of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities.

This project aims to:
- Automatically scan services for vulnerabilities based on their version numbers.
- Look up relevant exploits from popular databases like Exploit-DB and Metasploit.
- Provide a seamless workflow to download and run exploits.
- Log all exploit attempts for future review and analysis.

### Features:
- **Automated Exploit Lookup**: Finds vulnerabilities in common services like Apache, FTP, and more by matching service versions with known exploits.
- **Custom Exploit Execution**: Integrates with tools like Metasploit to automate the exploitation process.
- **Service Detection**: Uses `nmap` and other tools to detect open services and map them to exploits.
- **Logging**: Records each exploit attempt and its success/failure for further analysis.

This is a great tool for those new to cybersecurity and penetration testing who want to learn more about real-world exploitation techniques in a safe and ethical manner.

## How to Use:
1. **Scan Services**: Start by scanning a target using tools like `nmap` to find open ports and running services.
2. **Look Up Exploits**: Use the Exploitation-Module to search for related vulnerabilities and exploits.
3. **Run Exploits**: Automate exploit execution using built-in scripts or external tools like Metasploit.
4. **Review Logs**: Check the logs to see the outcome of each exploit attempt.

Stay tuned for more updates as I or any Contributers expand the toolâ€™s capabilities!
