# Exploitation-Module: Automated Vulnerability Exploitation Tool

Welcome to **Exploitation-Module**, an easy-to-use terminal-based tool designed to help cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers automate the process of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities.

This project is perfect for those new to cybersecurity and penetration testing, offering a real-world experience in automating the exploitation workflow using scanning, exploit fetching, and logging.

## Features:
1. **Service Scanning**: Automatically scan a target for open ports and running services using Nmap, and gather version information that could be vulnerable.
2. **Exploit Lookup**: Search popular databases like Exploit-DB to find known exploits based on the detected service versions.
3. **Exploit Logging**: Log each exploit attempt, recording the service targeted, the exploit used, and whether the attempt was successful or not.
4. **Modular Design**: Each feature is implemented as a separate script, making it easy to extend the tool with additional functionality.

## How It Works:
1. **Scan Services**: Start by scanning a target IP to identify running services and their versions using Nmap.
2. **Fetch Exploits**: Search for exploits related to the detected services on Exploit-DB.
3. **Log Exploits**: Record each exploit attempt, including the target service, exploit name, and the result (success/failure).

### Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webpro255/Exploitation-Module.git
   cd Exploitation-Module
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies (if required):
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the tool using Python 3:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
### Usage:

Once you run the `main.py` file, you will see the following menu:

`Welcome to Exploitation-Module!
1. Scan for services
2. Fetch exploits for a service
3. Launch an exploit and log the attempt
4. Exit`

**Option 1**: Scans a target IP for services using Nmap.
**Option 2**: Fetches exploits related to a given service from Exploit-DB.
**Option 3**: Logs the details of an exploit attempt.
**Option 4**: Exits the tool.

### Example:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

- Select option `1` to scan for services.
- Select option `2` to fetch exploits for services like `Apache` or `vsftpd`.
- Select option `3` to log your exploit attempts.

### Logs:
All exploit attempts are logged in the `logs/exploit_attempts.log` file. The logs contain timestamps and details about each exploit attempt for future analysis.
